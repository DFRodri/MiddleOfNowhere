# MiddleOfNowhere - Lisbon
<p>Project #5 of the Android Basics Nano-Degree</p>

### Short Description

<p>They asked us, students, to design something that could be used as a Tour APP, or something similar to that, and at the same time to test skills</p>
<p>Use of a View Pager plus Tab Layout or Navigation Drawer was mandatory. Here is the result.</p>

## How it works

<p>Simple APP that shows four tabs with a list of options that the user can check.</p>
<p>Each tab is a different theme and each item of each theme is clickable and provides a new screen with useful info.</p>

## Here are some screenshots

<p>Note: Screenshots use an old version of the icon used. Recent one is a lot better</p>

## Here is a video showing it working (Recorded with Android Studio so no audio)
